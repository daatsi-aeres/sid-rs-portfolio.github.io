intro: Implemented and compared the image generation capabilities of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) in PyTorch using a dataset of 17 different species of flowers. Also investigated the performance of DiscoGAN and CycleGAN architectures for style transfer between Pansy and Tigerlily.
